                    going into the area and do your part by leaving no trace on your hike.

                    <p>The Dumoine River Valley has been a favourite destination for backcountry paddlers for decades, and now hiker's have the same 
                      opportunity to explore this area by foot. This region is sparsely populated and there is no cell reception. In the event of an emergency, help will not be 
                      readily available, and it could take a significantly long period of time to get to you. Plan on being self sufficient while using the trail, and consider 
                      carrying a satellite communication device. As always, it is a best practice to tell loved ones your plan and estimated return date.

                      In the event of an emergency, help may take a very long time to get to you. A beautiful backcountry presents challenges for evacuations. The Dumoine River 
                      is canoe access only and helicopters have limited areas to land. See <a href="#" >below</a> for more information.</p>

                    <p>
                      There are several notable historic sites along the Dumione Tote Road including several stopping places with an agricultural history. At the height of the Timber 
                      Trade, thousands of men lived and worked in camps all along the river. As a result, evidence of human presence can be seen frequently, presenting an exciting 
                      opportunity to connect to those who lived and worked here. Beware of glass bottles and sharp metal debris which can frequently be found throughout the region. 
                      Also of note is a telegraph wire which was installed between the Ottawa River and the Fildegrand River (Southern half of the trail). While efforts have been made 
                      to mark the wire with coloured tape, tree falls may cause the wire to cross the trail presenting another hazard. Beware of the historic debris while you walk and 
                      camp along the Dumoine River, and please leave all objects where they lay. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Note in the picture how the telegraph wire can be difficult to spot if caught unaware - it runs from the lower left upward and to the right!</p>

                    <p>
                      At the approximate half-way point on the Dumoine Tote Road Trail, the path meets the Fildegrande River, the site of a historic farm and a bridge which has long 
                      since washed away. To continue to the rest of the trail, crossing this river is required and can be a fun, exciting feature of this backcountry trail. During the 
                      Summer months, it is usually possible to ford the Fildegrande on foot, with water levels reaching waist height. In the spring months, or after heavy rains, the 
                      Fildegrande can swell and pose a significant challenge. Volunteers have made an effort to stash two canoes (one on either side) to help in the event that the river 
                      is not fordable. Please use these only at your own risk, and do not underestimate the power of the Fildegrande when it is swollen. For advice on how to safely ford 
                      a river, please see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlmWxsaG_Ns" target="_blank">this video</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Fildegrand crossing is shown here with low water levels - the photographer noted that the water ran at about knee height in this picture, taken on a fall hike.</p>

                    <p>
                      As previously mentioned, the Tote Road trail is a true backcountry experience, and as a result, evacuations in the case of an emergency will be very challenging. 
                      There is no cell reception on this trail, so satellite communication devices are recommended. Even in the case of successfully contacting  emergency responders, 
                      it will be many hours before they are able to locate and maneuver to your location and many hours more before you can be evacuated to reach medical facilities. 
                      Gauge your skillset, risk tolerance and equipment before hiking this trail and determine if it is right for you. Travelling with experienced hikers, taking a 
                      wilderness first aid course and writing down an emergency plan are all great ways to minimize your risk.

                    <p>
                      The Dumoine River Tote Road was originally built for the timber industry in the 19th century, and has been reclaimed from decades of disuse by a small but 
                      dedicated group of volunteers. Hundreds of fallen trees have been cleared from the trail and several new bridges have been installed, but no official organization 
                      has taken a leadership role in this effort. Maintenance is still done entirely by volunteers. The trail can sometimes be difficult to follow and it may take time 
                      between storms and when volunteers can sweep the trail with chainsaws. Pay attention to where you're going and look for signs of human presence if you get lost 
                      (cut branches, ruts of the old road, trail signs and flagging tape). Take care in climbing over or under fallen trees and protect your eyes from fallen branches 
                      or overgrown sections. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Lots of work has gone into clearing the trail, but you will likely need to climb over or under fallen trees on some sections of trail, especially after recent storms.</p>
