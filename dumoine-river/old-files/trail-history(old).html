                    The Dumoine has been a trade route linking first nations people from the north and east with others coming from the south and west for centuries. 
                    The Ottawa River was the main trade route where they met sometimes at the mouth of the Dumoine other times at traditional meeting places further up or down the mighty Kichi Sipi. 
                    The Ottawa River watershed is the traditional home of the Algonquin Nation and the Dumoine was the traditional home of the Dumoine River Band of that nation. 
                    This band, a group of 12 families, created the first portages and hunting trails in the watershed.

                        Travel by birchbark canoe by the band involved both upriver and downriver travel on the Dumoine and Ottawa Rivers.                      </p>

                        Early French Traders recognized the trade potential at the Dumoine mouth on 
                        their way to establish a fort on Lac Temiscamingue. Trade and travel was severely 
                        interrupted by the Beaver Wars involving the Haudennaussonee (five nation Iroquois) 
                        and the Anishnabe and Wyandot/Wendat (Huron) people. 
                        The original post on *Lac Temiscamingue was destroyed by Seneca Warriors during this 
                        period as was the village on Morrison Island. Lac Temiscamingue was a short upriver trip 
                        for the Dumoine Band families via Lac Dumoine and the Kipawa River. A parade of European explorers, 
                        soldiers and priests joined the traders passing by and sometimes stopping at the Dumoine in the 1600s, including
                        Etienne Brule 1608, Nicholas de Vignau 1611, Samuel de Champlain 1615, Jean Nicollet de Belle Borne 1618, 
                        Récollet Père Joseph LeCaron 1615, Récollet Nicholas Viel/Gabriel Sagard 1623, Jesuit Jean de Brébeuf (1626),

                      After the great Peace Treaty is signed in Montreal ended the Beaver wars, French Merchant Paul Guillet purchased 
                      the trade licence for the Ottawa River watershed. He built a new Fort Temiscamingue at the narrows where it still 
                      exists today and temporary posts at Grande Lac Victoria,Lac Dumoine and the mouth of the Dumoine. 
                      Trade goods were carried to Temiscamingue in the new 36` Canot du Maître and to the outposts in the smaller 26` North Canoe.
                      The Dumoine Band would have seen, traded, built and even crewed a lot of these canoes. 
                      Two more French explorers and one Odawa warrior marked the end of the French Era.

                      <p>In the winter, teamsters, usually local farmers using their own horses and sleighs, would be paid by the pound to haul for loads of feed for the men and horses. 
                        They would “Tote” their loads into the camps. Hundreds of teams consisting of two horses and one man hauling 2000 pound loads would travel up the tote road many times each winter. 
                        Their travel limit per day was about 12 miles so crude homesteads with extra stables and bunkhouses were established to shelter the men and horses, 
                        by the lumber companies or entrepreneurial families, at this distance.</p>

                    <p>Timber slides and Lumberjacks</p>
                  </header>
                  <p>Throughout the four centuries since 1600, European traders, priests, lumbermen, settlers, forest rangers and sportsmen adopted these trails for their own purposes. 
                    The lumber trade, which began cutting the big pines of the Dumoine in the 1830s, was dependent on huge amounts of supplies 
                    (estimated at three pounds for every board foot cut) to run their winter cutting operations.</p>
                  <p>To accomplish this they built a road, suitable for horse-drawn sleighs and wagons, from the mouth of the Dumoine to the shanty camps along the Dumoine and Fildegrande Rivers. 
                    The cut logs were moved by the floodwaters of the spring on annual river drives, so all the shanties were close to water flowing into these two rivers.</p>

                  </header>
                  <p>In the 1900s the forest was patrolled by forest rangers watching for fires from a series of fire towers throughout the Dumoine Valley. 
                  The Tote road became the access route for these rangers and their fire fighting equipment. 
                  Lastly, a new breed of urban sportsmen, keen on the Dumoine hunting and fishing experience, walked up the Dumoine Tote Road to their cabins beginning in 1918.</p>
                  <p>By 1960 air patrols by float planes were used to locate fires. Improved trucks and bush roads all replaced the forest rangers, the river drives and offered an alternative for the walk-in sportsmen. 
                    The Tote Road was then abandoned to nature.</p>

                      <p>In the winter, teamsters, usually local farmers using their own horses and sleighs, would be paid by the pound to haul for loads of feed for the men and horses. 
                        They would “Tote” their loads into the camps. Hundreds of teams consisting of two horses and one man hauling 2000 pound loads would travel up the tote road many times each winter. 
                        Their travel limit per day was about 12 miles so crude homesteads with extra stables and bunkhouses were established to shelter the men and horses, 
                        by the lumber companies or entrepreneurial families, at this distance.</p>

                      <p>On the Dumoine Tote road the Dufoe family was at the beginning, at the mouth of the Dumoine, then the Bertrand Family was at the junction of the Dumoine and Fildegrande Rivers where the road split. 
                        Another 8 miles up the Dumoine was the Potvin family stopping place, and 8 miles up the Fildegrande was a logging company stopping place at Dixon Lake called ‘Halfway’. 
                        There was a company stopping place at Robinson Lake four miles from the Potvin’s and another at Rowanton, 10 miles from Robinson Lake, above Grande Chute.
